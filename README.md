# intune-enterprise-baselines

Enterprise-style Intune security baselines, compliance policies, and troubleshooting playbooks designed to mirror real-world endpoint engineering practices.

---

## Purpose
This repository demonstrates how enterprise endpoint and desktop engineers design, document, and maintain Windows endpoint baselines in a structured environment.

It focuses on **engineering standards**, **compliance enforcement**, and **troubleshooting methodology** rather than live production configurations.
